hexBrush3.1.js
pull functions out of draw() into global
(didn't need to de-p5ify since they will
be called in setup)
pull brush transforms/ mark-making into a 
loop in setup()
nothing in draw() anymore
todo: use a separate canvas for bg
todo: use 3d transforms? 
name idea: soul writer

hexBrush3.1
review what parts to keep
-isoTight looks good
-stackTilt pretty nice
-stackFlat good
change name to hexBrush4
existing draw technique of moving across the screen can be one of many
how to zoom out, keep in border, add geographic control structures, use extra canvas
idea for control structures:
-one big ellipse, 3 small ellipses
-random x,y within inner border
-use dist() to detect collisions
