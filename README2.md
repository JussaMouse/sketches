# SoulWriter 23

- I am a cosmetic accessory for Ethereum addresses.
- The 16 bits that determine my output are taken from
  the first 4 characters of your address after the 0x.
- All addresses starting with 0xABCD... will have the
  same output, because it is determined by the 'ABCD'.
- You can preview any of my 2^16 possibilities by
  entering another address.
- Transfering me triggers me to update.
- Push SPACE for HUD.
- Push P to preview an address.
